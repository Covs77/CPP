# 🚀 42 C++ Piscine – Object-Oriented Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of introductory C++ projects developed as part of the 42 Campus curriculum. The focus is on learning modern C++ concepts through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), adhering strictly to clean coding practices and memory safety.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

Each project progressively introduces key C++ principles and techniques, following the C++98 standard and strict compilation flags (`-Wall -Wextra -Werror`). This ensures a solid understanding of the language foundations before moving into more advanced topics.

### ✨ Topics Covered:
- Basics of C++ syntax and structure
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Operator and function overloading
- Modular and reusable code design
- Handling command-line arguments
- Good coding practices & strict compiler rules

## 💡 Philosophy

These projects are part of the C++ Piscine from 42, a peer-to-peer learning model with no teachers, where students learn by building and helping each other. The goal is not only to learn C++, but to **think like a developer**.

## 🛠️ Compilation

All programs are compiled with:

```bash
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98
